# Computer-16
 
**Computer-16 was created with** <a href="https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution">**Logisim Evolution**</a> **and the `.circ` file in the `src` directory can be run with Logisim Evolution (regular logisim does not have all the required components) to see how the computer works**

## What the computer can do:
> **The computer was designed to be as simple as possible, therefore functionality is limited but it still can do a lot of basic thing like r/w to registers or memory**
>
>**The computer is useless without code telling it what to do so I created `SPL` a programming language which is syntacticaly similar to assembly but functions slightly differently, this can be found in the** <a href = "https://github.com/DimaGalkin/SPL">**SPL Repo**</a>

## How to run <a href = "https://github.com/DimaGalkin/SPL">**SPL**</a> Code:
> **Once SPL code is written and compiled with SPLC (details in the** <a href = "https://github.com/DimaGalkin/SPL">**SPL Repo**</a>**) it can be uploaded into the Logisim ROM, to do this you must set the output SPLC to -D8 which will output one `.hex` file which can be uploaded into the ROM by right clicking and selecting "Load Image". Once uploaded start the clock and select the clock speed in the Logisim menu and the computer will execute the code uploaded into the ROM!**

## IRL Build Of Computer-16:
>**I have stated compiling a parts list and will publish it along with details of how to assemble Computer-16 on a breadboard soon.**
